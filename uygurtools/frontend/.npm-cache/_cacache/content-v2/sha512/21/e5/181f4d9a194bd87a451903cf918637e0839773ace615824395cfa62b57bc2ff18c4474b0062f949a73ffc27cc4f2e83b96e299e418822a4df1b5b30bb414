But otherwise, accepts **all webpack** versions (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\n## Usage\n\nChange your webpack config from\n\n```javascript\nconst webpackConfig = {\n  plugins: [new MyPlugin(), new MyOtherPlugin()],\n};\n```\n\nto\n\n```javascript\nconst SpeedMeasurePlugin = require(\"speed-measure-webpack-plugin\");\n\nconst smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin();\n\nconst webpackConfig = smp.wrap({\n  plugins: [new MyPlugin(), new MyOtherPlugin()],\n});\n```\n\nand you're done! SMP will now be printing timing output to the console by default.\n\nCheck out the [examples folder](/examples) for some more examples.\n\n## Options\n\nPass these into the constructor, as an object:\n\n```javascript\nconst smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin(options);\n```\n\n### `options.disable`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf truthy, this plugin does nothing at all.\n\n`{ disable: !process.env.MEASURE }` allows opt-in measurements with `MEASURE=true npm run build`.\n\n### `options.outputFormat`\n\nType: `String|Function`<br>\nDefault: `\"human\"`\n\nDetermines in what format this plugin prints its measurements\n\n- `\"json\"` - produces a JSON blob\n- `\"human\"` - produces a human readable output\n- `\"humanVerbose\"` - produces a more verbose version of the human readable output\n- If a function, it will call the function with the JSON blob, and output the response\n\n### `options.outputTarget`\n\nType: `String|Function`<br>\nDefault: `console.log`\n\n- If a string, it specifies the path to a file to output to.\n- If a function, it will call the function with the output as the first parameter\n\n### `options.pluginNames`\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: `{}`\n\nBy default, SMP derives plugin names through `plugin.constructor.name`. For some\nplugins this doesn't work (or you may want to override this default). This option\ntakes an object of `pluginName: PluginConstructor`, e.g.\n\n```javascript\nconst uglify = new UglifyJSPlugin();\nconst smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin({\n  pluginNames: {\n    customUglifyName: uglify,\n  },\n});\n\nconst webpackConfig = smp.wrap({\n  plugins: [uglify],\n});\n```\n\n### `options.loaderTopFiles`\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `0`\n\nYou can configure SMP to include the files that take the most time per loader, when using `outputFormat: 'humanVerbose'`. E.g., to show the top 10 files per loader:\n\n```javascript\nconst smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin({\n  outputFormat: \"humanVerbose\",\n  loaderTopFiles: 10,\n});\n```\n\n### `options.compareLoadersBuild`\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: `{}`\n\nThis option gives you a comparison over time of the module count and time spent, per loader. This option provides more data when `outputFormat: \"humanVerbose\"`.\n\nGiven a required `filePath` to store the build information, this option allows you to compare differences to your codebase over time. E.g.\n\n```javascript\nconst smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin({\n  compareLoadersBuild: {\n    filePath: \"./buildInfo.json\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### `options.granularLoaderData` _(experimental)_\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nBy default, SMP measures loaders in groups. If truthy, this plugin will give per-loader timing information.\n\nThis flag is _experimental_. Some loaders will have inaccurate results:\n\n- loaders using separate processes (e.g. `thread-loader`)\n- loaders emitting file output (e.g. `file-loader`)\n\nWe will find solutions to these issues before removing the _(experimental)_ flag on this option.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What does general output time mean?\n\nThis tends to be down to webpack reading in from the file-system, but in general it's anything outside of what SMP can actually measure.\n\n### What does modules without loaders mean?\n\nIt means vanilla JS files, which webpack can handle out of the box.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributors are welcome! ????\n\nPlease check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Migrating\n\nSMP follows [semver](https://semver.org/). If upgrading a major version, you can consult [the migration guide](./migration.md).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](/LICENSE)\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji
